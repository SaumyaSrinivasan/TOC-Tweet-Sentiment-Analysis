# Rail Service Monitoring and Customer Sentiment Analysis Application

Project Overview
Rail services play a pivotal role in national transportation infrastructure, providing efficient passenger and cargo transport. However, challenges like rising operational costs, reliability concerns, limited accessibility, and evolving consumer preferences have led some travelers to seek alternative transportation modes. This project aims to address these challenges by building a monitoring and visualization tool tailored for Train Operating Companies (TOCs), with a focus on enhancing customer satisfaction and service efficiency.

Objective
This application leverages data from social media interactions—primarily Twitter—to analyze customer sentiment and pinpoint service pain points. By tracking and analyzing various metrics, including:

Complaint Handling Ratios
Passenger Sentiment Ratios and Categories
Delays and Compensations
Fare Changes
Complaint Resolutions
the project provides TOCs with data-driven insights into recurring issues and customer pain points. Armed with these insights, TOCs can identify the root causes of dissatisfaction, address operational inefficiencies, and ultimately drive higher customer satisfaction and service usage.

Key Features
Sentiment and Trend Analysis: Identify trending topics, popular routes, preferred seating options, and cancellation patterns by analyzing social media content, hashtags, and customer sentiments.
Real-time Alerts and Updates: Offer actionable insights into real-time delays, travel alerts, and on-demand passenger assistance.
Data-driven Recommendations: Provide recommendations for TOCs on improving onboard amenities, ticketing, customer service, and train reliability.
Benefits
This project enables TOCs to move from reactive issue management to a proactive approach that anticipates and addresses potential service disruptions. By doing so, TOCs can improve:

Customer Satisfaction: Through enhanced amenities, streamlined services, and responsive customer support.
Environmental Impact: By attracting more passengers to rail services, thereby reducing road congestion and carbon emissions.
Economic Growth: Efficient rail services support national development and foster a customer-centric transportation infrastructure.


PS: I have included a sample tweet dataset, but the TOC statistics data is private and cannot be shared publicly. Only files without confidential information have been uploaded. The entire project has not been posted as it contains sensitive data, and I was advised not to make it publicly accessible.
