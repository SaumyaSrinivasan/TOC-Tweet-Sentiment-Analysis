# Rail Service Monitoring and Customer Sentiment Analysis Application

This project develops a monitoring and visualization tool for Train Operating Companies (TOCs) to enhance service quality and customer satisfaction. By analyzing social media data, primarily from Twitter, it identifies service issues through metrics like complaint handling, sentiment trends, delays, and fare changes. Key features include trend analysis, real-time alerts, and actionable recommendations for service improvements, such as better amenities, responsive support, and reliability. This proactive approach boosts customer satisfaction, reduces environmental impact by encouraging rail usage, and supports national economic growth through a more efficient transportation system.
This project enables TOCs to move from reactive issue management to a proactive approach that anticipates and addresses potential service disruptions. By doing so, TOCs can improve:

Customer Satisfaction: 
Through enhanced amenities, streamlined services, and responsive customer support.

Environmental Impact: 
By attracting more passengers to rail services, thereby reducing road congestion and carbon emissions.

Economic Growth: 
Efficient rail services support national development and foster a customer-centric transportation infrastructure.


PS: I have included a sample tweet dataset, but the TOC statistics data is private and cannot be shared publicly. Only files without confidential information have been uploaded. The entire project has not been posted as it contains sensitive data, and I was advised not to make it publicly accessible.
